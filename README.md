# Python Project

# 🪨 Rock–Paper–Scissors Game (Python)

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a beginner-friendly **Rock–Paper–Scissors game** built using Python.  
The project allows a user to play against the computer through the terminal, where the computer randomly selects its choice and the program determines the result based on simple logic.

An additional feature of this project is **text-to-speech output**, which announces the choices and the final result, making the game more interactive and engaging.

This project was created as my **first Python project** to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts.

## ▶️ How the Game Works

1. The user enters their choice:
   - `r` for Rock  
   - `p` for Paper  
   - `s` for Scissors  

2. The computer randomly selects one option.

3. The program compares both choices using conditional logic.

4. The result (Win / Lose / Draw) is:
   - Displayed on the screen  
   - Announced using voice output
