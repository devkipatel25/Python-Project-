# Python Project
Hello everyone,

This is my first Python project — a Rock–Paper–Scissors game.

In this project, the computer randomly selects rock, paper, or scissors using Python’s random module, while the user provides their choice through terminal input.

I used dictionaries to map user input to numeric values, which makes comparison and decision-making easier. Based on these values, the program determines whether the user wins, loses, or if the game is a draw.

An additional feature of this project is text-to-speech output using the pyttsx4 library, which announces both the choices and the result, making the game more interactive.

This project helped me understand Python fundamentals such as conditional statements, dictionaries, library usage, and user input handling.
